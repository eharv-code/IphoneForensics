This is a forensics report I created for my cybersecurity bootcamp.

I created a fictious company as required by the assignment,and in case you have not jumped into my other repositories, at the time I was using Tidy Stacks based of the idea of releasing memory cleanly and not causing leaks or overflows. 

While it was my first time writing a forensics report, it was not my first time styling a legal document. Equally, also having a considerable amount of experience working in museums I really enjoyed leveraging my versatile academic background
for this assignment. This was originally an exercised designed for the specialist training at the Naval academy.  At the time, though not made explicit perhaps in the .pdf showcased here, the pedagogy of the assignment lacks a clear understanding of how museums operate as well as the legal veracity of evidence collected by using a keylogger and the doctrine of fruit of the poisonous tree. Additionally, the pedagogy did not take into account the causes of action of crime statues. As a result I tried to shore up these deficiencies in my report creating an extensive and non standard report that that properly establishes causes of action by the legal statute as well as evidentiary importance of the findings in the iphone.

For this project we used the open-source Autopsy Software (Basis Technology) on Ubuntu Linux. We created the all important hash of the imaged iPhone and from there on dug into the image and conducted e-discovery. 

Digging into an imaged iPhone to paticipate in the discovery process of examining text messages, emails, iPhone Camera images, and GPS location data was by far one of the most rewarding assignments. What was additionally enjoyble was some of the email attachments were encrypted requiring additional research to decrypt. As a result, I learnt how to decode base 64 encoded strings and get the resulting audio, and learned how to use fcrackzip, a Kali utility that unlocks encrypted .zip files.

An area of opportunity of course would be that despite finding the open-source Autopsy gui very easy to navigate, most investigations prefer proprietary software such as EnCase and FTKimager.

The report document has a table of contents that is easy enough to navigate through however, to summarize: It contains a brief outline of the conspiracy cause of action, details of the iphone, followed by evidence that fits the cause of action, how the evidence relates in a general timeline, and, GPS data plotted on a map.
